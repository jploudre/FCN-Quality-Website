Hey Devyn,

I'm trying to get your code up and running.

I'll create some documentation if that helps -- you've got mostly boilerplate. Since I'm a newbie, I can tell that it isn't working for me. :-)

I'm trying to get the spec part to work. I'm a newbie -- only have been using python for a year so when I try to get examples through the test suite, I'm having trouble.
